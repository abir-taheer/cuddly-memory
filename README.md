### First Time Setup
1. Clone the repository 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/abir-taheer/cuddly-memory.git
    ```
2. Enter the project directory 
    ```
    cd cuddly-memory
    ```
3. Install dependencies for both the node.js server application as well as the front-end react application
    ```
    cd client
    npm install 
    cd ..
    npm install
    ```

### Development Steps
1. Start the node.js server application with hot reloading.
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
2. Start the front end react application
    ```
    cd client 
    npm start
    ```

This should open a browser window that leads to your react application. The react application will automatically hot reload.
